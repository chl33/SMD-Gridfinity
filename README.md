# SMD-Gridfinity

This is a collection of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) designs for storage of SMT components
for hobbyist/home assembly of PCBAs.  These are designed to work with Gridfinity, using the
[Gridfinity Rebuilt](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad) project.

## SMD pick-bins

[Bins/](Bins) is a set of SMD pick-bins.
